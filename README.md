## Description

A game where you are a dragon and you need to finish your tax return quickly. Pen and paper and calculator recommended.

**Where are forms D-347 and D-223?**

There are none. That was from an early version of the game and the text wasn't removed in time.

**Why are there no deductions?**

Dragons rarely actually spend their hoards, so they have no expenses to deduct.

**Why does a dragon have a smartphone?**

It's 2105.
